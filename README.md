# Screenlogger


This script enables you to automatically take screenshots at a chosen interval.
It is designed to run in complete stealth mode.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/AquaParrot/Screenlogger.git
cd Screenlogger
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Stopping the monitor requires a stepwise hotkey sequence

Ctrl + Shift + Tab → S → Q

The sequence must be completed within 3 seconds, or it resets automatically.
